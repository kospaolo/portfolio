        <h4>FULL-STACK SOFTWARE ENGINEER</h4>
        <h1>PAOLO KOS</h1>
        <p>
          I am a full-stack web developer with a master's degree in informatics
          from the University of Rijeka. I have a passion for creating
          innovative and intuitive web applications that make a positive impact
          on people's lives.

          <br />
          <br />

          Currently, I work as a full-stack engineer. I use my skills in HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue.js, Angular, Node.js, and MongoDB to
          build complex websites and feature-rich web applications. In addition
          to my professional experience, I have also expanded my expertise
          through self-directed learning, gaining proficiency in Firebase,
          Figma, and other tools. This continuous learning helps me stay ahead
          of industry trends and enhance my ability to deliver high-quality
          solutions.

          <br />
          <br />

          I have contributed to several exciting projects, such as developing a
          dynamic menu system, optimizing the user interface, and implementing a
          secure payment gateway. I enjoy collaborating with my team to find the
          best solutions to challenging problems, and I am always eager to learn
          new technologies and frameworks.
