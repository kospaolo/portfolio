Built with Angular, Node.js, and Firebase, it streamlines invoicing and offer management with features like creating, updating, and deleting invoices/offers, customer management, and generating branded PDFs using jsPDF. While the app can and will be improved, I'm proud that it successfully fulfills its intended purpose. It is responsive, secure, and customizable for business needs.",
